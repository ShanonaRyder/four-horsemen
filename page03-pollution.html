        <p>The first horseman, Pestilence (also known as Conquest) rides in “conquering and to conquer” on a white horse with a bow and crown. When interpreted as Pestilence, 
        they are associated with infectious disease and plague</p>
        <p>“The third of the four horsemen took over when Pestilence retired. They’ve had lots of interesting jobs in lots of interesting places, helped design the petrol engine, 
        plastics and high tech weed killers. They’ve killed as many people as Famine or as War.” </p>
