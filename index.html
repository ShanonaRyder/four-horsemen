        <p>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are figures present within the Christian faith that first appeared in the final book of the New Testament, Revelation, where it 
                occupies a central place in Christian eschatology. The horsemen are the first four out of seven seals that, when broken, will mark the Second Coming of Christ and 
                the beginning of the divine apocalypse, announcing the Final Judgement of God. </p>
        <p>In Revelation, the order in which the horsemen arrive are: Conquest, (referred to as Pestilence in the Old Testament) War, Famine and Death. However, in the television 
                series <em>Good Omens</em> written and created by Neil Gaimen based on his and Terry Pratchett's novel of the same name, the order was moved around slightly. This is the lore 
                we will be focusing on.</p>
